DESCRIPTION 
In this project, we are using Unity to build an interactive and realistic interior 
decoration environment. Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) allows for 
high-quality graphics and performance, making it ideal for creating detailed 3D 
environments. Unity, supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms, 
simplifies the development process with its powerful editor and extensive set 
of tools. 
Unity, developed in 2005, has remained a leading tool in the game and 
simulation development industry, offering robust features while being 
accessible to developers of all skill levels. The engine supports both 3D and 2D 
graphics, providing flexibility in art style choices. Each graphic type includes 
specialized tools and script APIs tailored for various physics options, ensuring 
a seamless development experience. 
For virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), Unity stands as a key platform, 
supporting the latest VR headsets with numerous packages that are regularly 
updated. This makes Unity a versatile choice for both traditional game 
development and innovative projects in VR and AR. 
In our project, we utilize Unity's capabilities to import 3D models of furniture, 
walls, and floors, apply realistic materials, and implement dynamic lighting. 
Player movement is enabled through a first-person controller, allowing users to 
navigate and interact within the space. Optimization techniques such as Level 
of Detail (LOD) and occlusion culling are employed to enhance performance. 
Unity has been the foundation for many popular games and applications, 
including Pokémon Go, Fall Guys, Cuphead, and Hollow Knight. Our interior 
decoration project leverages Unity's strengths to create an immersive and 
engaging experience, showcasing the engine's versatility and power.


Methodology for Unity-Based Interior Decoration Project 
 Setting Up Unity and URP 
 Designing the Interior Scene 
 Creating and Applying Materials 
 Setting Up Lighting (Directional and Point Lights) 
 Implementing Player Movement (FirstPersonMovement and FirstPersonLook) 
 Developing Interaction Scripts 
 Optimizing Performance (LOD, Occlusion Culling, Baked Lighting) 
 Testing and Iterating 
 This Project is built from scratch


How to Use the Unity-Based Interior Decoration Project 


1. Install Unity: - Download and install Unity (version 2020.2 or higher) from the 
Unity Hub. 
2. Open the Project: - Launch Unity and open the project folder using the "Open" option 
in the Unity Hub. 
3. Navigate the Scene: - Use the Scene view to explore the interior environment. Click on 
objects to select and inspect them. 
4. Play the Scene: - Click the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to enter Play mode. 
Use the WASD keys and mouse to move around and interact with the 
environment. 
5. Interact with Objects: - Approach interactive objects like doors or lights and use the 
designated key or mouse action to interact with them. 
6. Modify the Scene: - Use the Inspector and Hierarchy panels to modify the layout, 
7. Optimize and Test: - Continuously test the scene in Play mode, optimizing 
performance using LOD, occlusion culling, and baked lighting.
